	\begin{abstract} %this is the abstract it is here to hold the question in which I am exploring
		Open Source Software (OSS) can usually be updated and downloaded at no cost.
		\\As OSS continues to grow and improve will commercial companies be forced to improve their costs or products to compete?
		\\Do you think that OSS will have a positive / negative effect on the quality of the software?
	\end{abstract}
	With this report I will be exploring various avenues of OSS and places in which it is used, 
	along with positives and negatives in regards to it's use. I will use some examples such as Linux and the use of OSS
	in medical fields.\citep[]{verborgh2016triple}
