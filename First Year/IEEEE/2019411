Analog electronics device
Transistors - Enable digital systems
made of semiconductors (moores law)

Moores law - Number of Transistors that can be put on a chip doubles roughly every two years

two types of semiconductor 

pnp and npn

extra pos or neg charge

The diode is two types of semiconductor material

converting analog to digital, use an ADC (Analog to digital convertor)

Sample waveform periodically
depending on waveform, it will need a high or low sampling frequency

1hz = once per second

music sampling frequency 44100 Hz = 44KHz

AM - Amplitude modulated

FM - Frequency Modulated
